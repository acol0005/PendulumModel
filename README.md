```


Create and activate a new virtual environment. 
```python3 -m venv pendulumenv
. pendulumenv/bin/activate
```
Ensure that each line in your terminal is now prefixed with (pendulumenv), indicating the virtual environment is active. 
Every time that you open a terminal, check if the '(pendulumenv)' prefix is there. If it isn't, run the `.  pendulumenv/bin/activate` command from the PendulumModel directory to reactivate the virtual environment.
